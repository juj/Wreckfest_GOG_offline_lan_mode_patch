GOG Wreckfest LAN fix launcher
==============================

This launcher fixes up GOG's botched LAN support for Wreckfest.

It is based on DLLs from https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/-/jobs/4247811310/artifacts/download
See https://gitlab.com/Mr_Goldberg/goldberg_emulator/blob/master/README.md for more information.

The LAN player profile is set up to have 100 million credits and XP to allow unlocking all cars
and upgrades for casual LAN play.

Installation Instructions
